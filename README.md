>              **Description**
 The retro snake game is a classic arcade game that originated in the 
late 1970s and gained massive popularity in the 1990s with the 
introduction of Nokia mobile phones. Players control a snake that 
grows in length as it consumes food pellets. The game is 
characterized by its simple graphics and addictive gameplay.
Aim and Object
 The goal of the game is to guide the snake to eat as many food pellets as 
possible without colliding with obstacles or itself. As the snake consumes 
food, it grows longer, making navigation more challenging. The ultimate 
objective is to achieve the highest possible score before either running into a 
wall or the snake's own body.
